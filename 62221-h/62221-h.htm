<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>A
SERMON.</h2>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Mark ii</span>.
27:&mdash;&ldquo;And he said unto them, The Sabbath was made for
man, and not man for the Sabbath.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> discriminating symptoms of
hypocrisy or profaneness in a nation, it has been well said, are,
that, by the one, outward ordinances are raised to an exaggerated
importance; by the other, they are disparaged, depressed, and set
at nought.&nbsp; In the words just quoted, the aim of our Lord
appears to have been to put these institutions in their right
place,&mdash;to enunciate a great principle, by which we could
always distinguish between certain moral ends for which <i>man
was made</i>, and certain outward appointments which were
instituted and <i>made for man</i>.&nbsp; To obey God, to resist
evil, to fulfil a providential designation, to strive after
nearer conformity to the Divine image, to fit and capacitate the
soul for a higher condition of being, these are ends,&mdash;man
was <i>made for these</i>.&nbsp; But holy times, pious
commemorations, solemn assemblies, the temples where we worship,
and the sacraments whereof <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>we eat, these are only subsidiary and
divinely appointed means; they are not among the final objects of
man&rsquo;s creation.&nbsp; They were ordinances <i>wade for
man</i>.</p>
<p>This argument, it will be perceived, would be addressed with
much fitness to men, whose error, in relation to the Sabbath,
leaned to the side of an over-strained and impracticable
severity; and who had just been urging it as a complaint against
our Lord&rsquo;s disciples, that, in passing through a field on
the Sabbath-day, they had relieved their hunger by plucking a few
ears of corn.&nbsp; These cavillers are reminded, therefore,
that, in the economy of salvation, all outward ordinances are to
be viewed in the light of things secondary and subservient; their
mode of observance to be interpreted in harmony with the ends for
which they were ordained; and that, with regard to the Sabbath
especially, care must be taken to avoid both the hypocrisy that
would make the day to be honoured by a rigid ceremonial
exactness, and the presumption that would overlook its eternal
sanctity as standing in the will of God.&nbsp; It is in this last
view that all the ordinances of religion, when clearly of Divine
appointment, acquire a character of deep and momentous
interest.&nbsp; Their foundation is in the will of God; but that
will, as we know, has, as its ever-guiding and controlling rule,
a sacred regard to the highest interests of man.&nbsp; Nothing
can be more dishonouring to God, or more untrue, than to <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>speak of
outward ordinances as if they were mere arbitrary appointments,
without significance and without benefit, as only so many
meaningless enactments designed to test the willingness of human
subjection; so far otherwise, they are means framed upon a wise
and loving regard to all the aptitudes of our moral nature, and
calculated, in their reverent use, to help man through all the
difficulties of his course and to educate his immortal spirit for
the employments of the world to come.&nbsp; <i>The Sabbath
was</i> <span class="GutSmall">MADE FOR MAN</span>.</p>
<p>Brethren, you are aware of the reasons which induce me, at the
hazard of going over much of familiar argument, formally to
review the grounds on which we hold that a <span
class="GutSmall">PROPER MORAL SANCTITY</span> does attach to the
<span class="smcap">Christian Sabbath</span>:&mdash;that the
institution itself has an origin, an object, a typical
significance and value, which are independent of all economies,
and will endure to all time; and, therefore, that any nation
which shall presume to tamper with its unalterable sacredness, is
drawing down upon itself those awful maledictions which, by an
undesigned coincidence, have been so often recited in our ears
this morning as the just retribution of <span
class="smcap">polluted Sabbaths</span>. <a
name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a></p>
<p>I.&nbsp; In trying to arrive at correct notions upon what may
be due to the sacred day, and how far it may be lawful that
churches and places of amusement <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>should share its hours between them,
our first thoughts are naturally directed to the Old Testament
accounts of the Sabbath institution itself.&nbsp; Was its origin
paradisaical, or patriarchal, or Levitical?&nbsp; And if it were
either of these, were the reasons given for commencing it such as
would pass away, when the dispensation under which it was given
passed away?&nbsp; This question is important, because there is a
current way of speaking of the Sabbath as if it were a mere
festival of the Jewish Church, deriving its whole sanctity from
the Levitical law, and only taken up by the Christian Church at
second hand,&mdash;as among the <i>useful</i> things of the old
economy which it would be as well to perpetuate, though not one
of the <i>binding</i> things we were under any obligation to
observe.</p>
<p>Now, to expose the absurdity of this notion, we have only to
take the earliest Scripture notices of the institution which come
to hand.&nbsp; In the second chapter of the book of Genesis, at
the close of the account of the creation, we read,&mdash;<i>And
on the seventh day God ended his work which He had made</i>;
<i>and He rested on the seventh day from all his work which He
had made</i>.&nbsp; <i>And God blessed the seventh day and
sanctified it</i>: <span class="GutSmall">BECAUSE</span> <i>that
in it He had rested from all his work which God created and
made</i>.&nbsp; If this passage stood alone, one conclusion only
could be drawn from it; namely, that the institution of the
Sabbath succeeded the creation immediately in order of time, and
that it was <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>sanctified for reasons which must be binding on all
mankind alike.&nbsp; But other notices in the writings of Moses
follow, which might seem to militate against this view, and even
to favour the erroneous notion I have adverted to, of the Sabbath
having only a temporary or dispensational sanctity.&nbsp; Thus,
in the thirty-first chapter of Exodus, we
read,&mdash;<i>Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the
Sabbath throughout their generations for a perpetual
covenant</i>: <i>it is a</i> <span class="GutSmall">SIGN</span>
<i>between me and the children of Israel for ever</i>.&nbsp;
Whilst, further, in the book of Deuteronomy, at the fifth
chapter, we find Moses exhorting the people to the observance of
the holy day, with this added reason: <i>Remember that thou wast
a servant in the land of Egypt</i>, <i>and that the Lord thy God
brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and stretched-out
arm</i>; <span class="GutSmall">THEREFORE</span> <i>the Lord thy
God commanded thee to keep the Sabbath-day</i>.&nbsp; Now,
whether we are able to give any satisfactory account of these
additional reasons for the institution or not, the revealed fact
will remain the same,&mdash;namely, that the Sabbath was
<i>not</i> Levitical in its origin, and was not even <i>first</i>
made known to the Jews, at the giving of the law.&nbsp; Nothing
can be plainer than that the Sabbath was both known and observed
before the Jewish Church had any existence.&nbsp; For, besides
the incidental notices both before and after the
deluge,&mdash;such as Noah sending out the dove again
&ldquo;after other seven days,&rdquo;&mdash;we find the Jews
actually keeping a Sabbath <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>in the wilderness of Sin, before the
covenant of Sinai had been entered into.&nbsp; Thus, at the
giving of the manna, we have Moses saying unto the people,
<i>To-morrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord</i>:
<i>on that day ye shall not find it in the field</i>: <i>for the
Lord hath given you the Sabbath</i>: <i>therefore He giveth you
on the sixth day the bread of two days</i>:&mdash;language
plainly implying that, at that time, the Sabbath was an
established observance of the religious life.&nbsp; What shall we
say, then, of those <i>subsequent</i> reasons for the institution
which connect it with a peculiar national covenant? or with the
deliverance of the Israelites from bondage?&nbsp; Why, not that
they are meant to be reasons for the institution <i>itself</i>,
but reasons for a particular time and form of its
<i>re-promulgation</i>.&nbsp; The children of Israel, it is to be
remembered, had been for several hundred years under captivity in
Egypt.&nbsp; Many of their ordinances, it is likely they would
have forgotten; and their Sabbaths, it is all but certain, their
task-masters would not permit them to observe.&nbsp; On their
Exodus, therefore, it became necessary that there should be a
formal <i>re-enactment</i> of the holy day; not only by a
repetition of those moral considerations, on account of which the
Almighty had originally set it apart, but also with a recital of
such other arguments as should make the sanctity of the day
especially binding upon <i>them</i> as a nation; namely, that in
their revived and perpetuated Sabbath, they were to keep up a
grateful commemoration <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>of their deliverance from Egypt, as
well as behold a standing pledge or seal of the covenant into
which God was then entering with his people.&nbsp; To infer that
mankind had never observed a day of sanctified rest until the
Sabbath was made a sign of the covenant with Moses, would be as
unreasonable as the inference that the sun&rsquo;s light had
never been refracted in the rain-drops, until God set his
&ldquo;bow in the clouds,&rdquo; to be a sign of his covenant
with Noah.&nbsp; It pleased God to take an existing moral fact in
the one case, as He had taken an existing physical fact in the
other, to be a perpetual and visible memorial of his own gracious
purposes.&nbsp; And, surely, to the Israelites, in all ages, it
must have been a great encouragement to see the promise made unto
their fathers guaranteed by a seal, which was honoured as the
first token ever made to human kind, and hallowed by
considerations which could never change, and never lose their
force.</p>
<p>I say never lose their force;&mdash;for what could a
sanctified commemoration of the rest of the Great Creator, a
commanded acknowledgment, from the creatures He had made, of
their subjection and dependence, a periodical pause in their
other employments that they might hallow and bless his
name,&mdash;what, I say, could such reasons for an institution
have to do with one age more than another, or with one economy
more than another?&nbsp; Plainly, the obligation presses equally
on the first man Adam, and the last born of his degenerate <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>sons.&nbsp;
In this respect, the Sabbath was not made for Noah and the
patriarchs specially, to commemorate the world&rsquo;s second
birth; nor for Moses and the Israelites specially, to celebrate
the triumphs of the wilderness and the sea.&nbsp; It was made
neither for Jew, nor Christian, nor Church, nor age;&mdash;<i>The
Sabbath was made</i> <span class="GutSmall">FOR MAN</span>.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; Other reasons for the original and indelible
sanctity of this institution, I must note more briefly.&nbsp;
Thus, what other inference can be drawn from its place in the law
of the ten commandments,&mdash;that great summary of human
duty,&mdash;that searching code which, in its Gospel spirituality
and breadth, becomes the rule of all outward and inward holiness;
that eternal transcript of all creature obedience, which, when
heaven and earth shall have passed away, shall stand out as the
reflected will of God?&nbsp; <i>Think not</i>, said the Great
Teacher, <i>I am come to destroy the law or the prophets</i>,
<i>I am not come to destroy but to fulfil</i>.&nbsp; Will any
raise a question as to the law here intended being the moral law
given to Moses? or conceding that, will they say that when our
Lord declared neither <i>jot nor tittle</i> should pass from this
law, He meant to say, <i>men shall keep all the commandments
except the fourth</i>?</p>
<p>Again, in contending for the universal obligation to separate
a seventh portion of our time to the service of God, we cannot
overlook the plain intimations contained in the earliest records
of all nations, that, either with religious sanctions or <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>without them,
men have observed this <i>weekly</i> division of time.&nbsp;
Chaldeans, Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, all seem to have known
of it;&mdash;and the question is how, except as the relic of some
universal tradition, those nations should have thought of such a
measurement of time at all?&nbsp; For other divisions of time we
can find reasons,&mdash;obvious, necessary, and natural.&nbsp;
The daily rotation of the earth on its axis; the completed cycle
of lunar phases; the sun imparting to the revolving worlds the
blessings of cold and heat, summer and winter, seed-time and
harvest, are phenomena quite adequate to explain why we should
break up our life into <i>days</i>, and <i>months</i>, and
<i>years</i>; but for <span class="GutSmall">WEEKS</span> we have
<i>no</i> such reason, nor, indeed, <i>any</i> reason to give,
except that it is one of the original appointments and laws of
God.&nbsp; It is an arbitrary period, the recurrence of which
neither nature nor reason seems, in any way, to have marked out
for us, but which, on the all-commanding authority of revelation,
men have been taught to set apart to sacred remembrances.&nbsp;
<i>The Sabbath was</i> <span class="GutSmall">MADE</span> <i>for
man</i>.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; Thus, as far as our limits would permit, I think it
has been shown that, irrespective of dispensations, or Churches,
or particular covenants, God did appoint it as an ordinance for
the whole human family, that every recurring seventh day of their
life should be separated to religious uses.&nbsp; He first
&ldquo;<i>blessed</i>&rdquo; the day, that is, pledged himself to
be propitious to the service which, in spirit and in <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>truth, men
should offer Him on that day; and then
&ldquo;<i>hallowed</i>&rdquo; it, or, as the word is,
&ldquo;<i>set it apart</i>,&rdquo; intimating that anything
opposed or foreign to such religious service, was to be strictly
forbidden.&nbsp; If this ground have been made good, I shall be
less careful to adduce all that could be said in favour of the
next question which might be raised; namely, on the supposition
that God has made this claim upon all men of a seventh portion of
their time, is <i>that</i> seventh which has been set apart by
the Christian Church the <i>right</i> seventh; in other words,
have we sufficient reason for believing that the change of day,
from the <i>last</i> day of the week to the <i>first</i>, is
agreeable to the will of God?&nbsp; Now the only reasons, it
would seem, which could justify such change, must be found either
in an express revelation, or in the ascertained practice of
those, who having for three years had the Lord of the Sabbath to
guide them, must have known on what day He designed it should
thenceforth be kept.&nbsp; A change of the actual day, it has
been conjectured, from some expressions in the history, was made
by Moses, at the time of the Exodus, transferring the holy day to
that which first saw <i>Israel&rsquo;s redemption from
bonds</i>,&mdash;what should hinder that, with sufficient
authority, a change should not be made, again transferring our
Sabbath to the day which, in the resurrection of the Son of God,
saw the <i>redemption of the spiritual Israel from the
grave</i>?&nbsp; Besides, an avowed end of the Jewish Sabbath was
as <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>a
protest against false religions.&nbsp; The pious Israelite was
distinguished from the idolaters among whom he dwelt, by his
close observance of the sacred day:&mdash;why may not our Lord
have ordained a change in the Sabbath of the Christian, as a
protest against the continuing obstinacy of the Jew?&nbsp; Of
course, these are no more than conjectures, and though sustained
by names of great weight, they leave the fact to be judged of
only as we should judge of all other facts; namely, by a
reasonable and sufficient amount of historic evidence.&nbsp; And
this we are thought to have, even in the scattered notices found
in the sacred narrative itself,&mdash;in the frequent allusions
to religious meetings on the first day of the week, in the choice
of this day by our Lord for two successive manifestations to his
disciples, in the selection of it for the first miraculous
effusion of the Holy Spirit, in the special mention of it by Paul
as that on which he preached the Word and administered the
sacraments, in the directions given to the Churches of Galatia
and Corinth to lay by their alms that they might make an offering
of them to God on the first day of the week,&mdash;all passages
proving, as clearly as anything can, that, among the New
Testament Christians, a character of separation and sacredness
was attached to the <i>first</i> day, which was not accorded to
any other.</p>
<p>To these revealed notices is to be added the testimony of
other authorities, which, however lightly <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>we might
esteem them on any question of <i>doctrine</i>, are quite
competent to give their witness on a matter of <i>fact</i>.&nbsp;
Such, for example, are the well-known letters of the younger
Pliny, the universal consent of our Ecclesiastical historians,
and the constantly recurring allusions to the day by all the
Apostolic Fathers, under the familiar and apparently
well-understood designation of <span class="smcap">the
Lord&rsquo;s-day</span>.&nbsp; These proofs seem to bear out the
conclusion that, from the very morning of the Lord&rsquo;s
resurrection, the first day of the week came to be held of the
Christian world in all sanctity and reverence as the ordained
Gospel Sabbath.&nbsp; And as we may be quite sure that the
apostles would never have made such a change on their own
responsibility, we naturally refer it to some express though
unpreserved direction from Him, who, repudiating all unnatural
and constrained austerity on the one hand, and yet having regard
to the unchanging sanctity of moral ordinances on the other,
declared, <i>The Sabbath was made for man</i>, <i>and not man for
the Sabbath</i>.</p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; And now, brethren, I come to the practical
application of our subject, in the apprehended overthrow of all
that is dear to a Christian mind by the opening of a great public
exhibition on the Lord&rsquo;s-day.&nbsp; It is a topic which I
approach with much pain, not a little heightened by a fear lest
strong feeling should betray me into any infirmity&mdash;into any
word or sentiment inconsistent with the meekness and gentleness
of Christ.&nbsp; But I have <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>prayed to be kept from
this&mdash;have asked of God that I might nothing exaggerate,
nothing represent unfairly, nothing set down in the spirit of an
ill-tempered and scolding partisan&mdash;but rather that,
speaking in sorrow more than in anger, I might win <i>you</i> to
pray against this threatened evil&mdash;to pray against it as you
would against the pestilence, or other feared providential
scourge.&nbsp; This will not in any degree lead to a slackened
diligence in the use of outward means, as you perceive from the
first step I have invited you to take, in memorializing Her
Majesty&rsquo;s responsible advisers against this first step to a
new &ldquo;Book of Sports.&rdquo;&nbsp; But still, remember, the
thing to be done is to open eyes that are as yet blind, and to
alarm consciences that now slumber; and this is a work to be
done, not by might and not by power, not by wrangling and not by
wrath, but by the Lord of Hosts pouring out upon our people a
praying spirit, and enduing our beloved Queen with a wise and
understanding heart.</p>
<p>With a jealousy, therefore, that respects as well the
charitable temper required of a Gospel teacher, as the demands of
an unbending and unfearing faithfulness, I may not speak of the
contemplated opening of the new Exhibition on the
Lord&rsquo;s-day in any other terms than as an impious affront to
the honour of Almighty God&mdash;as a wanton outrage upon the
religious feelings of the surrounding neighbourhoods&mdash;as a
cruel encroachment upon the poor man&rsquo;s Sabbath
rights&mdash;and as a legalized <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>incentive to the most debasing forms
of viciousness and crime.</p>
<p>i.&nbsp; Look first, I say, at the <i>awful impiety</i> of
this project.&nbsp; The terms of the charter to which a
Protestant Queen is expected to set her hand and seal, set forth
that all entrance to this great pleasure-house is to be strictly
forbidden <span class="GutSmall">UNTIL ONE O&rsquo;CLOCK</span>;
but that, after that hour, unrestrained admission will be
afforded to that vast living tide, which, fed from tributary
streams in every direction, from the river, and from the land,
from monster steam-boats and monster trains, will have formed
itself into a huge heaving mass of riot and profaneness at the
so-called Palace doors.&nbsp; Well, here the first thought which
must occur to any reflecting mind is, wherefore this strange
bisection of the day into two such antagonistic parts?&nbsp;
Whence comes it that this stroke of a time-piece is to transfer
us, all at once, from a region of calm godliness, spiritual
worship, noiseless acts of beneficence and love, to one of
turbid, distracting, and tumultuous revelry?&nbsp; We look, I
say, for some revealed warrant for giving to any ordinance of God
this two-faced and self-contradicting character.&nbsp; Did the
Almighty sanctify half a Sabbath, or did He sanctify a whole
one?&nbsp; And if a whole one, where is our authority for
allowing His claim to <i>one</i> part of the day, but devoting to
the world the other?&nbsp; Brethren, these questions can be
answered but in one way.&nbsp; The entire scheme is dictated by
that wretched spirit of <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>compromise and
double-dealing&mdash;that impious endeavour to unite Christ and
Belial on the same throne, which has ever been the abominable
thing that God hateth.&nbsp; For the Infidel who ignores the
obligation of the Sabbath altogether, we have hope.&nbsp; He
<i>is</i> a consistent, and he <i>may</i> be an honest man; and
if so, who shall say how soon Christ may give him light?&nbsp;
But for the man who <i>has</i> light, and who only uses it to
serve God by halves&mdash;mingling loyalty with his rebellion,
professed homage with his insult, in the morning crying, Hosanna
to the Son of David; and in the afternoon, exclaiming, Let him be
crucified&mdash;for him we have not this hope.&nbsp; His is the
lukewarmness of Laodicea outdone.&nbsp; And should England lend
her countenance, to this dark impiety, what can she expect but to
hear from Him who walketh in the midst of the Churches and
holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, those awful words,
&ldquo;Because thou hast not kept my Sabbath from <span
class="GutSmall">POLLUTING</span> it, but hast <span
class="GutSmall">FOLLOWED THY PLEASURE</span> on my holy day, I
will pour out my fury upon thee, I will spue thee out of my
mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ii.&nbsp; Look, in the second place, at the <i>outrage</i>
which this desecration threatens to <i>the religious feelings</i>
of the adjacent neighbourhoods.&nbsp; It may be said that, in all
localities, religious people are the minority; and that if a
clear case can be made out of social convenience or benefit to
the many, the feelings of the few ought to give way.&nbsp; This
principle is one which I think it would be very dangerous to
admit.&nbsp; A <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>pious parent may have <i>nine</i> lovers of pleasure in
his household, for <i>one</i> that is a lover of God; yet he
frames his domestic arrangements in harmony with the right choice
of the <i>one</i>, and not with the mistaken wishes of the
nine.&nbsp; And a Government which would vindicate its parental
character must do the same.&nbsp; Besides, it is clear, that with
this question of numbers, how many good people we have to
legislate for, and how many bad, the powers that rule have
nothing to do.&nbsp; If they are the sworn conservators of the
Protestant faith, and if that faith regards the Lord&rsquo;s-day
as an institution of perpetual sanctity, the very
<i>listening</i> to the plea of expediency is the betrayal of a
trust; and the <i>acting</i> upon it a practical confession that
they look for a social benefit to the community, by a direct
infringement of the law of God!</p>
<p>To what end, then, I ask, (and it is a question in which we,
as a neighbourhood, are deeply interested,) to what end are we to
have every road, and walk, and thoroughfare, for many miles round
this projected focus of ungodliness, deprived of the peace, the
order, the quiet Sabbath respectability they have hitherto
enjoyed?&nbsp; Why are we to exchange the holy stillness, under
cover of which we now meditate, and read, and pray, for the
hoarse harsh din of Sabbath vehicles, of rabble throngs
exchanging their loud vulgarities on their way to the fair, and
shouting out their intoxicated and blaspheming songs as they are
returning home?&nbsp; Already, I am informed <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>on the
authority of residents in our own parish, living in the line of
road, that paths, hitherto sought and loved for their holy
Sabbath quiet, are now closed hopelessly against all who like
Isaac would fain go out to &ldquo;meditate at eventide,&rdquo;
owing to the throngs of impatient Sabbath-breakers going to see
their boasted temple rise.&nbsp; Brethren, I trust you will not
think,&mdash;especially I hope my poorer friends will not
think,&mdash;that I charge it upon the recreations of our humble
classes that they are <i>always</i> thus vociferous and coarse; I
charge it upon the recreation of those only who go out to pollute
God&rsquo;s holy day; and in regard to such persons there is no
exaggeration in the picture.&nbsp; Two or three times in the year
we have these Sabbath Saturnalia now; when the thoroughfare in
front of this church presents scenes which we are grieved to have
our children witness; but which, so soon as this new Babel of
profanation shall be reared,&mdash;this Greenwich fair under a
glass roof&mdash;we must expect to have enacted before their eyes
every Sabbath day.</p>
<p>iii.&nbsp; And then again, brethren, look at this project as
it must encroach cruelly upon the <i>poor man&rsquo;s Sabbath
rest</i>.&nbsp; It is a principle I fear but too little
understood by our labouring classes, that every step taken in the
direction of Sabbath desecration, for purposes of
<i>voluntary</i> pleasure, is a step in the same direction for
purposes of <i>compulsory</i> work.&nbsp; The principle of
sanctity once given up, the day brought down to the level of a
respectable church usage, a <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>master may consistently say to his
working men, &lsquo;If your conscience is lax enough to take
<i>pleasure</i> for your <i>own</i> sake, it surely cannot task
it much to do a little <i>work</i> for <i>mine</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And this principle once recognised, that an employer may get out
of his workmen a whole or half a day&rsquo;s more labour than he
used to do, competition or cupidity will soon make a
corresponding reduction in the rate of wages, until the labouring
man finds he gains no more for working <i>seven</i> days, than he
formerly did for working <i>six</i>.&nbsp; I have the fullest
persuasion that many a poor man is spared from <i>compulsory</i>
Sabbath labour now, because employers dare not, in the face of an
almost universal verdict of society in favour of the sacredness
of the day, force a workman&rsquo;s conscience.&nbsp; But let
society once cancel that verdict, let the workman show, by his
presence at the Sydenham fair, that he has no conscience to
force,&mdash;and the master&rsquo;s shame will soon depart from
him, and the labourer who refused to keep his Sabbath rest
<i>holy</i>, will find, as he deserves to find, that he will have
no Sabbath rest at all.&nbsp; Judge ye for yourselves, my humbler
brethren, who has most right to be called the <span
class="GutSmall">POOR MAN&rsquo;S FRIEND</span>.</p>
<p>But to come to more obvious and immediate mischief.&nbsp;
Judging from the former Exhibition it is not unlikely that, on a
fine Sunday, this huge daylight theatre will be visited by not
less than 100,000 people.&nbsp; These will require, for the most
part, carriages to convey them, meat and drink to refresh <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>them,
officials to take their money, policemen to keep them in
order.&nbsp; Now, only think what a fearful aggregate of Sabbath
labour this will compel.&nbsp; Make as rough a computation as you
may, of the time during which each visitor will be using the
services of some other person&mdash;at a railway office, on the
line, in the gardens, at places of refreshment; and remembering
that those persons whom the visitor <i>sees</i>, are obliged to
be assisted by many others whom he does <i>not see</i>, and a
result will be arrived at, showing that for this large number to
take their Sabbath <i>pleasure</i>, many thousands must be
deprived of their Sabbath <i>rest</i>.&nbsp; Nay, as if this work
of ruining souls could not be begun soon enough,&mdash;as if the
promoters of this unchristian scheme had a very appetite for
desecration,&mdash;the works are going on, there is reason to
believe, while I speak.&nbsp; Only last Sunday these British
slaves were seen at work by one known to me, who, going up to the
house of God to worship, had to hear the noise of axe and hammer
making discordant music with the church-inviting bell. <a
name="citation21"></a><a href="#footnote21"
class="citation">[21]</a>&nbsp; Now, brethren, to enable you to
appreciate the magnitude of this evil of depriving men of the
means of Sabbath instruction, I could wish for you nothing so
awfully convincing, as that you should witness what I have
witnessed often, both in this and a former incumbency,&mdash;the
latter end of those who, from their connexion with public
conveyances, were uniformly shut out from the sanctuary, <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>because they
had to minister to the pleasure-seeker, on God&rsquo;s holy
day.&nbsp; The recreation <i>to him</i>, was spiritual and
eternal death <i>to them</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">He</span>
found his mirth, but <i>they</i> lost a soul.&nbsp; Such
death-beds, I own, present a great mystery.&nbsp; When we see the
vacant wonderment with which the dying man listens to the most
elementary religious truths, or the judicial hardness which seems
proof against the most tender appeals, or the awakened emotion
which only lasts long enough to people the chamber of death with
the mocking spectres of despair, and then feel how much the blame
of all this belonged to <i>others</i> rather than to
<i>him</i>,&mdash;we are, for the moment, amazed.&nbsp; But the
answer comes speedily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Be still.&nbsp; The moral law
is eternal.&nbsp; My Sabbaths are for a <span
class="GutSmall">SIGN</span>.&nbsp; He who dishonours them in his
life, shall be himself dishonoured in his end; and, grievous as
may be the portion of him who has thus offended, to him by whom
the offence cometh there is a woe more grievous
still.&rsquo;&nbsp; Oh! brethren, pray we for these thoughtless
speculators that God curse them not in a granted desire; that He
lay not at their door the fearful responsibility of having
destroyed thousands of undying souls,&mdash;yea, that rather than
give them a Royal charter to make Christ&rsquo;s little ones
offend and fall, He would bestow upon them, what we have the
highest authority for declaring would be a less terrible boon;
even &ldquo;that a millstone were hanged about their neck and
they be drowned in the depth of the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>iv.&nbsp; Once more, brethren, I ask you to look at the
<i>demoralizing influence</i> of this contemplated impiety.&nbsp;
It was the great Burke, I believe, who once put forth the false
and mischievous sentiment, that &ldquo;vice lost half its danger
by losing all its grossness.&rdquo;&nbsp; On a like principle,
some appear to be contending now, that Sabbath immoralities will
lose much of their evil, if we can only qualify their coarseness
by the externals of cultivation and refinement.&nbsp; But sin is
sin, hide it under what mask we will.&nbsp; Whilst, as to moral
danger to the community, it is surely better that men should even
<i>see</i> the dead men&rsquo;s bones and all the uncleanness,
than that their eyes should be ensnared by the beauty of the
whited sepulchre.&nbsp; The Sabbath-breaker now is a marked man;
he steals away to his low tavern indulgences; he there herds with
his like; and, as a conscious offender against the laws of God
and man, waits till, under the protection of nightfall, he may
steal to his home again.&nbsp; But if the proposed arrangement be
brought about, he will commit the same offence,&mdash;under
authority, with Royal countenance, on the plea that he wishes to
enlarge the powers which God hath given him; nay, it is much if
he parrot not, at Infidel bidding, the audacious pretence that he
would offer a tribute of admiration &ldquo;to nature and to
nature&rsquo;s God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh! brethren, when will the race
be extinct who seek to betray the Son of man with a kiss?</p>
<p>But will not the project under consideration be a <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>gain to
public morals, in regard of the lower vices of sensuality and
intoxication?&nbsp; I answer unhesitatingly, No.&nbsp; Unhappily,
we are not without our precedent of these Sunday gardens
now&mdash;gardens which, in their disposition and decorations,
appeal, and in their degree successfully, to the very tastes
which it is among the purposes of the new speculation to
cultivate.&nbsp; And these pleasure-grounds are found to be the
heart and centre of the most debasing vices.&nbsp; Returns have
been put into my hands from one of these haunts of Sabbath
festivity in a country town,&mdash;described as being, in
themselves, most attractive and beautiful.&nbsp; Into these
gardens 3,000 people have gone on a Sunday evening, consuming
among them nearly 600 gallons of malt liquor alone;&mdash;a
quantity which, if a reasonable deduction be made for the number
of children, would suppose <i>one quart</i> to have been consumed
by <i>every grown-up person</i>, <i>whether male or female</i>,
upon the ground.&nbsp; Let us, for the honour of the female sex,
make a still further deduction, and what a humiliating reflection
is forced upon us as to the state of a large majority of the
men!&nbsp; Brethren, these are painful details to have to bring
into a pulpit.&nbsp; But when we have beaten the adversary from
every other ground&mdash;the ground of right, of truth, of
religious decency, of national piety and honour&mdash;it may be
well to see if he has any standing-place on the ground which he
thinks unassailably his own.&nbsp; And this argument, that he
will draw men <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>off from the brutal indulgences of their own locality,
is one which the champions of desecration make much of.&nbsp;
Whereas I know, on the authority of those through whose hands the
negotiations pass, that premiums of almost incredible amount are
being offered for the liberty of erecting places in the
neighbourhood, where the same low appetites may be ministered to,
which the Sabbath-breaker finds gratified now in his own low
tavern at home. <a name="citation25"></a><a href="#footnote25"
class="citation">[25]</a>&nbsp; And then judge for yourselves
whether he will be much less disposed to gratify them.&nbsp;
Think of the excitement of the journey, the sensuous fascinations
of the scene, the stimulating influence of a large living mass,
all bent on unrestrained enjoyment, <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>and then consider whether any other
change will be wrought, in the habits of those whom it is sought
to reclaim, than that they will do under some decorated and
emblazoned booth, what they now do in an alehouse, and waste far
more than they do already of those precious earnings which should
go to buy their children bread.&nbsp; And where the carcase is,
there will the eagles be.&nbsp; The cunning pickpocket will be
there.&nbsp; The man of dissolute pleasures will be there.&nbsp;
The shame of womanhood will be there;&mdash;all coming from far
to keep each the Sabbath of their vocation&mdash;to worship at
this great metropolis of immorality and sin.</p>
<p>Many other considerations there are, tending to make us view
the present movement with deep dismay.&nbsp; We fear it cannot
bode good to the cause of God and his truth, when Herod and
Pilate are made friends; when the Romanist and the Neologian are
urging the same forms of Sabbath observance; when &ldquo;Gebal
and Ammon and Amalek,&rdquo;&mdash;the man of science, the man of
pleasure, and the man of scrip and shares,&mdash;are all intent
on the same scheme of social amelioration.&nbsp; The fear is not
unnatural with us that the junction-point of this strange
confederacy will be found, not in any result which they wish to
<i>achieve</i>, so much as in some existing influence which it is
their common desire to <i>destroy</i>,&mdash;namely, the
influence of that pure and undefiled religion which teaches that
science must bow to Scripture, that covetousness is only another
name for idolatry, and that the <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>man who allows himself in vicious or
forbidden pleasures shall not have any &ldquo;inheritance in the
kingdom of Christ and of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; We can only regard
such united attempt as the first instalment of a yet more
extended plan, by which we are to become assimilated to the
profane usages of the Continent, until every place of public
amusement or resort, from the national Museum to the itinerant
puppet-show, shall throw open their doors to any Sabbath
wanderer, who may desire, under cover of law, to do despite to
God&rsquo;s holy day.&nbsp; The constant plea put forth for these
Sabbath recreations, that something must be done towards
elevating the moral and intellectual tastes of our people, is not
tenable for an instant.&nbsp; For, admitting the necessity, why
should not the time required for it be taken from one of the
<i>six</i> days now appropriated to the world, rather than from
the one only day which we now set apart for God?&nbsp; But the
whole is in true keeping with Infidel patriotism.&nbsp; It looks
only on its own things.&nbsp; It spares itself.&nbsp; And then,
when affecting a desire to redeem time for the improvement of the
poor, like him who in the parable spared to take of his own flock
and his own herd, it will not, by an hour, anticipate the closing
of the factory, but demands that half the time be taken away from
the few hours that are now given to the church. <a
name="citation27"></a><a href="#footnote27"
class="citation">[27]</a></p>
<p>One word more, and I have done.&nbsp; The former Exhibition
was opened with prayer.&nbsp; The act was <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>a declared
recognition of God&rsquo;s right to control our recreations, and
of the necessity of his blessing to make them either innocent or
happy.&nbsp; Will the projectors of the new undertaking <span
class="GutSmall">DARE</span> to open their building thus?&nbsp;
Will they, holding in their hands the outspread charter of
desecration, <span class="GutSmall">DARE</span>, with the breath
of invocation, to blaspheme the God of heaven?&nbsp; I hazard no
reputation for prophecy when I say they will <span
class="GutSmall">NOT</span>.&nbsp; For, though I have no right to
infer that they would hesitate at mocking <span
class="smcap">God</span> by such an act, if they thought it would
raise their shares, I am persuaded they would fear so to mock the
<span class="smcap">English people</span>.&nbsp; There is an
element of veneration in our national character, which will not
suffer itself to be outraged beyond a certain limit.&nbsp; Our
people, even the worst of them, have no love for gratuitous
profanations.&nbsp; If they <i>do</i> consent to sit down at
Belshazzar&rsquo;s feast, yet they will not drink wine out of the
sacred vessels.&nbsp; Hence, whoever may be present at the coming
inauguration of the god of this world in his palace, he will with
difficulty repress the feeling, &lsquo;I know this place is to be
opened in utter defiance of the laws of God, and therefore for me
to ask his blessing upon it would be as if a robber should first
kneel down and ask God that he might be successful in his
plunder, or as if the traducer of his neighbour&rsquo;s fame
should pray that he might have the benediction of heaven upon his
ill report.&rsquo;&nbsp; No, brethren, if this Charter be
granted, the building will be opened, as it has been <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>commenced,
without God, without a blessing, without a recognition of any
power in the universe save that of Belial, who is to direct the
pleasures of its votaries, and that of Mammon to fill the coffers
of its founders with the fruit of unhallowed gains.</p>
<p>For the honour of our religion, then, for the moral happiness
of our people, for the lengthening of our tranquillity, for the
salvation of our land,&mdash;let me entreat you, while there is
yet time, to protest against this uncalled-for impiety.&nbsp; Our
voice made itself heard a short time ago, when a crafty Socinian
influence, at the Post-Office, threatened our cherished
sanctities:&mdash;we deserve to lose our Sabbaths for ever, if
that voice be silent now.&nbsp; Wherefore, brethren, &ldquo;Watch
ye; stand fast in the faith; quit you like men; be
strong.&rdquo;&nbsp; Slacken not in your exertions, till all the
weapons both of heaven and earth are spent; until you have
vindicated your character as citizens, your rights as subjects,
your religious consistency as Protestants, your faith, and love,
and zeal, and piety, as Christians and as men of God.&nbsp; So
shall &ldquo;the Lord be entreated for our land,&rdquo; and the
on-coming &ldquo;plague be stayed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Amen.</p>
<h2><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span><span
class="smcap">Note</span> A.</h2>
<p>The statement that men are employed on the ground on the
Lord&rsquo;s-day, has been impugned, but in support of it I have
permission to cite the authority of that respected upholder of
our Sabbath sanctities, Joseph Wilson, Esq., of Clapham Park; who
<i>saw a large body of men at full work</i>, <i>with spades and
pickaxes</i>, <i>on his way to church</i>, <i>on Sunday
last</i>.&nbsp; The excuse set up for this is that these men were
engaged in <i>firing the clay</i>, and that the nature of this
work was such as not to allow of the fires going out without
serious loss.&nbsp; Without quoting some opinions given by the
men themselves, denying this alleged necessity, I may mention
that inquiries made in the neighbourhood by myself, convinced me
that work <i>is</i> done on the Sabbath&mdash;over and above
attending to the fires&mdash;though carried on in a way which
tall boards and the sealed lips of interested parties make it
difficult to detect.</p>
<h2><span class="smcap">Note</span> B.</h2>
<p>The challenge to those who profess such anxiety for elevating
the condition of the poor, to give up some of their <i>own</i>
time for the purpose, and not to &ldquo;rob God,&rdquo; is not
put forth merely as a fair argumentative point.&nbsp; It is a
grave suggestion which has been thrown out more than once,
whether there should not be <i>one half-day in the week</i>
agreed upon, through the length and breadth of the land, as the
labouring man&rsquo;s time for recreation and
self-improvement.&nbsp; In manufacturing districts, where labour
is paid for by the <i>quantity</i> done, leaving the workman
master of his own time, this half-day is <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>very
generally <i>taken</i>, and long usage has appropriated Monday
afternoon for the purpose.&nbsp; Why should not the convention be
extended to those who have to work by <i>time</i>?&nbsp; The
proposal seems to me to be worthy of all consideration.&nbsp; Let
every wharf, and mill, and factory, close on Monday, at two
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Let the national Museum, and other places of
intellectual improvement, be thrown open.&nbsp; Let the paid
Exhibitions, the Crystal Palace among them, lower their terms of
admission to some merely nominal price.&nbsp; Let Societies be
organized for providing lectures in the evening, on subjects of
popular interest.&nbsp; Let district reading-rooms be opened,
supplied with well-conducted newspapers, and other periodical
literature.&nbsp; Let the national school-room be available on
that evening for different adult classes, under the guidance of
the clergy, or other friends of social improvement.&nbsp; That
there is a desire among our poor to avail themselves of such
facilities as those here referred to, I have, for the most part,
<i>proved</i> in my own district; and should greater
opportunities be afforded by employers, not only, I believe,
would a change for good be effected in the social tastes and
habits of our people, but the way would be gradually prepared for
their realizing their Sabbaths as a &ldquo;<span
class="GutSmall">DELIGHT</span>,&rdquo; and, in the refined
exercises of sacredness and mercy, keeping them &ldquo;<span
class="GutSmall">HOLY UNTO THE LORD</span>.&rdquo;</p>

will sufficiently justify several of the foregoing

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There are no less than seven public-houses
now in course of erection, or about to be erected, near the
Crystal Palace, one of which is to cost &pound;30,000, and to
contain stabling for 500 horses, tea-gardens, &amp;c.&nbsp; The
road leading from Anerly is literally thronged from ten to six
o&rsquo;clock every Sunday, and persons of all grades are to be
seen there, some selling by the wayside, others gambling; and in
the roads on either sides of the way scenes of the most revolting
nature are taking place in open daylight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A labouring man, some two or three months since, took a
small cottage and large garden in the Anerly road, and opened it
as a beer-house and tea-gardens, and he now has from <i>four to
five hundred persons</i> in his ground on the Sabbath day.&nbsp;
Many more particulars of a like kind might be added, but with
great difficulty, owing to the <i>secrecy observed by all
parties</i>.&rdquo;</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
